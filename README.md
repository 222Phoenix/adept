Here are my mappings at the moment:

Top Left:

Tap: Control Alt Tab. In Windows, it's like Alt Tab but better because the switcher stays open without holding Alt

Middle Left:

Tap: DPI switcher. Cycles between slow, medium, and fast speeds

Middle Right:

Tap: middle click

Double Tap: Control Shift T, reopen tab

Hold: move the ball, zoom in and out

Top Right:

Tap: right click

Double tap: Control W, close tab

Hold: move the ball, scrolling (aka drag scroll)

Triple tap: toggle scrolling, exit by clicking any button

Bottom left:

regular left click

Bottom right:

Tap: escape key, to exit full screen on videos and dialog boxes

Hold: move the ball, volume up and down

Hold and tap top right, presses >, which is speed up in Youtube

Hold and tap middle right, presses <, which is slow down in Youtube

Top Left & Top Right combo: reset mode, for updating firmware

Top Right & Bottom Right combo: toggle scrolling, exit by clicking any button

I donâ€™t really use this (was more useful on the Ploopy Nano) but I also programmed it so that if capslock is pressed from a keyboard, the Adept will toggle scroll mode.
